<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Gopinath, a passionate Data Engineer with 9 years of experience in handling large-scale data systems, 
  cloud technologies, and automation. Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with AWS services like Glue, S3, 
  and Snowflake, building efficient data pipelines and optimizing workflows. 
  My expertise lies in transforming raw data into meaningful insights, helping businesses make data-driven decisions
  with confidence.</p>

<p>Recently, I have taken on the exciting challenge of learning Web Development to expand my skill set beyond data 
  engineering. I am currently exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web frameworks to understand how front-end and 
  back-end systems work together. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and web applications by integrating 
  data-driven solutions into user-friendly interfaces.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a reflection of my learning journey in web development, where I showcase projects and experiments 
  as I grow in this field. As someone who enjoys problem-solving and continuous learning, I am eager to apply my 
  experience in data engineering to build scalable and interactive web applications. The combination of data and 
  web technologies opens up endless possibilities, and I am excited to explore them further.</p>

<p>I believe that technology is all about making life easier, and I am dedicated to creating solutions that add value. 
  Whether it's designing efficient data pipelines or developing intuitive web applications, my focus is always on 
  innovation and optimization. If youâ€™d like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out!</p>
